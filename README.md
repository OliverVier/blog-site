# General

This app acts as a blog and tutorial site.
I want to help as many people as possible learning programming in general or in more specialized topics.
For me it also acts as a way to learn Svelte and SvelteKit and get into the JavaScript ecosystem, also deploying the project
world-wide would be a first for me.

# Technologies

- Svelte + SvelteKit
- `maybe some ui library` ^^
- might be using Postgres, probably not required
- NodeJS

# The Idea

I want the site or a external tool to convert markdown files into html. The converted files are then served as plain html or bundled
as a svelte page, not sure on that yet.
